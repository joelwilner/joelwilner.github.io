Hello! My name is Joel Wilner, and I am a Ph.D. candidate at Dartmouth College (Hanover, NH, USA).

My research explores the captivating ways our planet's cryosphere evolves, with a particular focus on mountain glacier response to climatic variations in the past, present, and future. I am further motivated by the role of glacial erosion in sculpting landscapes and the application of surface exposure dating techniques to unravel the timing of glacier fluctuations, especially in the tropics. To address these problems, my work relies heavily on computational modeling and the analysis of large datasets, supplemented by field expeditions to Arctic and tropical alpine environments. 

Beyond my research, I am an avid hiker and “peakbagger,” with lifelong goals to summit the tallest peak of every state in the USA (current count: 49/50) and of 100 countries around the world (current count: 39/50).
